  info: Alberto Castellini is a fixed-term researcher (Rtd-b) at the Computer Science department of the University of Verona. His research interests focus on the development of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Analysis techniques, with applications on intelligent systems of various kinds, such as, cyber-physical systems, robotic systems, smart grids and smart buildings. The main methodologies he works on are predictive models for multivariate time series, methods for planning under uncertainty, reinforcement learning, regression and clustering techniques, interpretability of predictive models, situation assessment and anomaly detection. Alberto Castellini has participated in numerous national and international research projects dealing with the development of predictive and decision-making models. His main works are published in international scientific journals on artificial intelligence and intelligent systems (e.g., Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Intelligent Systems, Robotics and Autonomous Systems). The international conferences he has contributed to as an author are, for example, the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) and the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) and International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS). He also participates in conference program committees such as AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, the Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence and others in the field of artificial intelligence.
