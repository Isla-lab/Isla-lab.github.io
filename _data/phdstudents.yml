  info: Francesco Trotti is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Verona in collaboration with Leonardo S.p.A. His research focuses on developing control techniques that integrate nonlinear control strategies with online reinforcement learning model-based algorithms while considering model and/or environment uncertainties. He also focuses on designing control strategies for multi-agent systems, particularly emphasizing the collaboration and coordination aspects of multi-agents. The possible application ranges from designing controllers for manned or unmanned fixed-wing sub supersonic vehicles to controlling robotic manipulators or mobile robots.

  info: is a PhD candidate at the University of Verona, advised by Prof. Alessandro Farinelli and Prof. Ferdinando Cicalese. He has recently been a visiting researcher in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), advised by Prof. Changliu Liu. His main research interests focus on developing efficient and reliable methods for verifying and enhancing the explainability of deep neural networks (DNNs). He also developed probabilistic verification algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees to bridge the gap between Formal Verification of DNNs and safe deep reinforcement learning. The results of his research resulted in several publications at top-level international conferences and prestigious collaborations with world-leading universities.
