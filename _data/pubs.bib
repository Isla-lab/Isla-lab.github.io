	volume = {62},
	abstract = {Biclustering represents an intrinsically complex problem, where the aim is to perform a simultaneous row- and column-clustering of a given data matrix. Some recent approaches model this problem using factor graphs, so to exploit their ability to open the door to efficient optimization approaches for well designed function decompositions. However, while such models provide promising results, they do not scale to data matrices of reasonable size. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this issue, by proposing a novel approach to biclustering based on factor graphs, which yields high quality solutions and scales more favorably than previous methods. Specifically, we cast biclustering as the sequential search for a single bicluster, and propose a binary and compact factor graph that can be solved efficiently using the max-sum algorithm. The proposed approach has been tested and compared with state-of-the-art methods on four datasets (two synthetic and two real world data), providing encouraging results with respect both to previous approaches based on factor graphs and to other state-of-the-art methods},

	abstract = {To act effectively under uncertainty, multi-robot teams need to accurately estimate the state of the environment. Although individual robots, with uncertain sensors, may not be able to accurately determine the current situation, the team as a whole should have the capability to perform situation assessment. However, sharing all information with all other team mates is not scalable nor is centralization of all information possible. This paper presents a decentralized approach to cooperative situation assessment that balances use of communication bandwidth with the need for good situation assessment. When a robot believes locally that a particular plan should be executed, it sends a proposal for that plan, to one of its team mates. The robot receiving the plan proposal, can either agree with the plan and forward it on, or it can provide sensor information to suggest that an alternative plan might have higher expected utility. Once sufficient robots agree with the proposal, the plan is initiated. The algorithm successfully balances the value of cooperative sensing against the cost of sharing large volumes of information. Experiments verify the utility of the approach, showing that the algorithm dramatically out-performs individual decision-making and obtains performance similar to a centralized approach.},

	abstract = {We develop an efficient algorithm for computing pure strategy Nash equilibria that satisfy various criteria (such as the utilitarian or Nash--Bernoulli social welfare functions) in games with sparse interaction structure. Our algorithm, called Valued Nash Propagation (VNP), integrates the optimisation problem of maximising a criterion with the constraint satisfaction problem of finding a game's equilibria to construct a criterion that defines a c-semiring. Given a suitably compact game structure, this criterion can be efficiently optimised using message-passing. To this end, we first show that VNP is complete in games whose interaction structure forms a hypertree. Then, we go on to provide theoretic and empirical results justifying its use on games with arbitrary structure; in particular, we show that it computes the optimum >82% of the time and otherwise selects an equilibrium that is always within 2% of the optimum on average.},

In this paper we focus on a dynamic model for forming stable coalitions of selfish agents. Specifically, we consider the dynamic coalition formation approach proposed by Arnold and Schwalbe, where agents decides at each time step which of the existing coalition to join so to maximise their pay-off. We propose several key extensions to the approach to speed-up convergence and alleviate the computational burden for the agents. Our empirical analysis comprises two complementary scenarios: collective energy purchasing, where a set of energy consumer forms coalition to buy energy at reduced tariffs, and a synthetic benchmarking scenario. Our results in these scenarios indicate that our proposed extensions provide a speed-up in run time of up to four orders of magnitude with respect to the original approach.},

	year = {2017},
	journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
	volume = {59},
	abstract = {Coalition formation is a fundamental approach to multi-agent coordination, and a key challenge in this context is the coalition structure generation problem, where a set of agents must be partitioned into the best set of coalitions. This problem is NP-hard and typical optimal algorithms do not scale to more than 50 agents: efficient approximate solutions are therefore needed for hundreds or thousands of agents. In this paper we propose a novel heuristic, based on ideas and tools used in the data clustering domain. In particular, we present a coalition formation algorithm inspired by the well known class of hierarchical agglomerative clustering techniques (Linkage algorithms). We present different variants of the algorithm, which we call Coalition Linkage (C-Link) and demonstrate how such algorithm can be adapted to graph restricted coalition formation problems (where an interaction graph defined among the agents restricts the set of feasible coalitions). Moreover, we discuss how we can provide an upper bound on the value of the optimal coalition structure, and we show that for specific characteristic functions we can provide such bounds while maintaining polynomial computational costs and memory requirements. We empirically evaluate the different variants of the C-Link algorithm on two synthetic benchmark data-sets, as well as in two real world scenarios, involving a collective energy purchasing and a ride-sharing application. In these settings C-Link achieves promising results providing high quality solutions and solving problem involving thousands of agents in few minutes},

	booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems},
	abstract = {Team oriented plans have become a popular tool for operators to control teams of autonomous agents (or robots) to pursue complex objectives in complex environments. Such plans allow an operator to specify high level directives and allow the team to autonomously determine how to implement such directives. However, the operators will often want to interrupt the activities of individual team members to deal with particular situations, such as a danger to a robot that the robot team cannot perceive. Previously, after such interrupt, the operator would usually need to restart the team plan to ensure its success. In this paper, we present an approach to encoding how unexpected interrupts can be smoothly handled within a team plan. Building on a team plan formalism that uses Colored Petri Net, we describe a mechanism that allows a range of interrupts to be handled smoothly, allowing the team to efficiently continue with its task, after the operator intervention. We validate the approach with an application of robotic watercraft and show improved overall efficiency. In particular, our interrupt mechanism decreases the time to complete the mission (up to 48% reduction) and decreases the operator load (up to 80% reduction in number of user actions).},

	year = {2014},

	volume = {57},
	abstract = {This paper tackles the problem of parallelizing heterogeneous computational tasks across a number of computational nodes (aka agents) where each agent may not be able to perform all the tasks and may have different computational speeds. An equivalent problem can be found in operations research, and it is known as scheduling tasks on unrelated parallel machines (also known as R∥Cmax). Given this equivalence observation, we present the spanning tree decentralized task distribution algorithm (ST-DTDA), the first decentralized solution to R∥Cmax. ST-DTDA achieves decomposition by means of the min–max algorithm, a member of the generalized distributive law family, that performs inference by message-passing along the edges of a graphical model (known as a junction tree). Specifically, ST-DTDA uses min–max to optimally solve an approximation of the original R∥Cmax problem that results from eliminating possible agent-task allocations until it is mapped into an acyclic structure. To eliminate those allocations that are least likely to have an impact on the solution quality, ST-DTDA uses a heuristic approach. Moreover, ST-DTDA provides a per-instance approximation ratio that guarantees that the makespan of its solution (optimal in the approximated R∥Cmax problem) is not more than a factor ρ times the makespan of the optimal of the original problem. In our empirical evaluation of ST-DTDA, we show that ST-DTDA, with a min-regret heuristic, converges to solutions that are between 78 and 95% optimal whilst providing approximation ratios lower than 3.},

	volume = {28},
	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the generic problem of how a network of physically distributed, computationally constrained devices can make coordinated decisions to maximise the effectiveness of the whole sensor network. In particular, we propose a new agent-based representation of the problem, based on the factor graph, and use state-of-the-art DCOP heuristics (i.e., DSA and the max-sum algorithm) to generate sub-optimal solutions. In more detail, we formally model a specific real-world problem where energy-harvesting sensors are deployed within an urban environment to detect vehicle movements. The sensors coordinate their sense/sleep schedules, maintaining energy neutral operation while maximising vehicle detection probability. We theoretically analyse the performance of the sensor network for various coordination strategies and show that by appropriately coordinating their schedules the sensors can achieve significantly improved system-wide performance, detecting up to 50 % of the events that a randomly coordinated network fails to detect. Finally, we deploy our coordination approach in a realistic simulation of our wide area surveillance problem, comparing its performance to a number of benchmarking coordination strategies. In this setting, our approach achieves up to a 57 % reduction in the number of missed vehicles (compared to an uncoordinated network). This performance is close to that achieved by a benchmark centralised algorithm (simulated annealing) and to a continuously powered network (which is an unreachable upper bound for any coordination approach).},

	abstract = {Extreme teams, large-scale agent teams operating in dynamic environments, are on the horizon. Such environments are problematic for current task allocation algorithms due to the lack of locality in agent interactions. We propose a novel distributed task allocation algorithm for extreme teams, called LA-DCOP, that incorporates three key ideas. First, LA-DCOP's task allocation is based on a dynamically computed minimum capability threshold which uses approximate knowledge of overall task load. Second, LA-DCOP uses tokens to represent tasks and further minimize communication. Third, it creates potential tokens to deal with inter-task constraints of simultaneous execution. We show that LA-DCOP convincingly outperforms competing distributed task allocation algorithms while using orders of magnitude fewer messages, allowing a dramatic scale-up in extreme teams, upto a fully distributed, proxybased team of 200 agents. Varying threshold are seen as a key to outperforming competing distributed algorithms in the domain of simulated disaster rescue},

We evaluate CFSS on two benchmark functions, the edge sum with coordination cost and the collective energy purchasing functions, comparing its performance with the best algorithm for CSG on synergy graphs: DyCE. The latter approach is centralised and cannot be efficiently parallelised due to the exponential memory requirements in the number of agents, which limits its scalability (while CFSS memory requirements are only polynomial). Our results show that, when the graphs are very sparse, CFSS is 4 orders of magnitude faster than DyCE. Moreover, CFSS is the first approach to provide anytime approximate solutions with quality guarantees for very large systems (i.e., with more than 2700 agents).},

	abstract = {The problem of assigning tasks to a group of robots acting in a dynamic environment is a fundamental issue for a multirobot system (MRS) and several techniques have been studied to address this problem. Such techniques usually rely on the assumption that tasks to be assigned are inserted into the system in a coherent fashion. in this work we consider a scenario where tasks to be accomplished are perceived by the robots during mission execution. This issue has a significative impact on the task allocation process and, at the same time, makes it strictly dependent on perception capabilities of robots. more specifically, we present an asynchronous distributed mechanism based on Token Passing for allocating tasks in a team of robots. we tested and evaluated our approach by means of experiments both in a simulated environment and with real robots; our scenario comprises a set of robots that must cooperatively collect a set of objects scattered in the working environment. Each object collection task requires the cooperation of two robots. The experiments in the simulation environment allowed us to extract quantitative data from several missions and in different operative conditions and to characterize in a statistical way the results of our approach, especially when the team size increases.},

Our approach is based on a factor graph representation of the constraint network.

It then uses the max-sum algorithm to optimally solve the resulting tree structured constraint network, and provides a bounded approximation specific to the particular problem instance. In addition, we present two generic pruning techniques to reduce the amount of computation that agents must perform when using the max-sum algorithm. When this is combined with the above mentioned approximation algorithm, the agents are able to solve decentralised coordination problems that have very large action spaces with a low computation and communication overhead. We empirically evaluate our approach in a mobile sensor domain, where mobile agents are used to monitor and predict the state of spatial phenomena (e.g., temperature or gas concentration). Such sensors need to coordinate their movements with their direct neighbours to maximise the collective information gain, while predicting measurements at unobserved locations. When applied in this domain, our approach is able to provide solutions which are guaranteed to be within 2% of the optimal solution. Moreover, the two pruning techniques are extremely effective in decreasing the computational effort of each agent by reducing the size of the search space by up to 92%.},

To date, most work in this area focus on providing users with real time feedback on energy prices and consumption, or on load scheduling of home appliances for individual user consumption. In this paper, we take a complementary approach by exploiting social relationships among consumers to organise them into coalitions of Virtual Electricity Consumers (VECs) that buy electricity as a single customer in order to get a discount on electricity through collective buying. Specifically, we model our problem as a coalitional game and provide an algorithm, based on linear programming, to form VECs. The VECs formed by our algorithm are both efficient (i.e., minimizing the sum of users' payments) and stable (i.e., no user has any incentive to break away). We empirically analyse our approach using real consumption data for a set of households located in UK. Our analysis provides interesting insights into the relationship between structure and stability of VEC's and prices within the electricity market.},

the task assignment process. We propose a conflict resolution
method based only on point to point messages. The approach
is able to guarantee a conflict free allocation using a very limited
communication bandwidth. We also present an extension
to make the system robust to possible network failures.

	abstract = {Cooperative control is a key issue for multirobot systems in many practical applications. In this paper, we address the problem of coordinating a set of mobile robots in the RoboCup soccer middle-size league. We show how the coordination problem that we face can be cast as a specific coalition formation problem, and we propose a distributed algorithm to efficiently solve it. Our approach is based on the distributed computation of a measure of satisfaction (called Agent Satisfaction) that each agent computes for each task. We detail how each agent computes the Agent Satisfaction by acquiring sensor perceptions through an omnidirectional vision system, extracting aggregated information from the acquired perception, and integrating such information with that communicated by the teammates. We empirically validate our approach in a simulated scenario and within RoboCup competitions. The experiments in the simulated scenario allow us to analyse the behaviour of the algorithm in different situations, while the use of the algorithm in real competitions validates the applicability of our approach to robotic platforms involved in a dynamic and complex scenario.},

	abstract = {We consider Bucket Elimination (BE), a popular algorithmic framework to solve Constraint Optimisation Problems (COPs). We focus on the parallelisation of the most computationally intensive operations of BE, i.e., join sum and maximisation, which are key ingredients in several close variants of the BE framework (including Belief Propagation on Junction Trees and Distributed COP techniques such as ActionGDL and DPOP). In particular, we propose CUBE, a highly-parallel GPU implementation of such operations, which adopts an efficient memory layout allowing all threads to independently locate their input and output addresses in memory, hence achieving a high computational throughput. We compare CUBE with the most recent GPU implementation of BE. Our results show that CUBE achieves significant speed-ups (up to two orders of magnitude) w.r.t. the counterpart approach, showing a dramatic decrease of the runtime w.r.t. the serial version (i.e., up to 652x faster). More important, such speed-ups increase when the complexity of the problem grows, showing that CUBE correctly exploits the additional degree of parallelism inherent in the problem.},

Specifically, we address the generic problem of maximising social welfare within a group of interacting agents. We propose a novel representation of the problem, as a cyclic bipartite factor graph, composed of variable and function nodes (representing the agents' states and utilities respectively). We show that such representation allows us to use an extension of the max-sum algorithm to generate approximate solutions to this global optimisation problem through local decentralised message passing. We empirically evaluate this approach on a canonical coordination problem (graph colouring), and benchmark it against state of the art approximate and complete algorithms (DSA and DPOP). We show that our approach is robust to lossy communication, that it generates solutions closer to those of DPOP than DSA is able to, and that it does so with a communication cost (in terms of total messages size) that scales very well with the number of agents in the system (compared to the exponential increase of DPOP). Finally, we describe a hardware implementation of our algorithm operating on low-power Chipcon CC2431 System-on-Chip sensor nodes.},

Alternatively, in this demonstration we propose to exploit the consumers social side by allowing them to self-organise into coalitions of energy users with complementary needs. To this ends, we present an agent-based Java simulation of a social network of energy consumers (based on the domestic electricity market and usage patterns of homes in the UK) that uses to converge to stable energy coalitions.},

	abstract = {Solving complex but structured problems in a decentralized mannervia multiagent collaboration has received much attention in recentyears. This is natural, as on one hand, multiagent systems usuallypossess a structure that determines the allowable interactionsamong the agents; and on the other hand, the single most pressingneed in a cooperative multiagent system is to coordinate the localpolicies of autonomous agents with restricted capabilities to servea system-wide goal. The presence of uncertainty makes this evenmore challenging, as the agents face the additional need to learnthe unknown environment parameters while forming (and following)local policies in an online fashion. In this paper, we providethe first Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) approach for distributedcoordination and learning in a cooperative multiagent systemby devising two solutions to this type of problem. More specifically,we show how the Value of Perfect Information (VPI) can beused to perform efficient decentralised exploration in both modelbasedand model-free BRL, and in the latter case, provide a closedform solution for VPI, correcting a decade old result by Dearden,Friedman and Russell. To evaluate these solutions, we present experimentalresults comparing their relative merits, and demonstrateempirically that both solutions outperform an existing multiagentlearning method, representative of the state-of-the-art.},

	year = {2010},
	journal = {COMPUTER JOURNAL},
	volume = {53},
	abstract = {Emergency responders are faced with a number of significant challenges when managing major disasters. First, the number of rescue tasks posed is usually larger than the number of responders (or agents) and the resources available to them. Second, each task is likely to require a different level of effort in order to be completed by its deadline. Third, new tasks may continually appear or disappear from the environment, thus requiring the responders to quickly recompute their allocation of resources. Fourth, forming teams or coalitions of multiple agents from different agencies is vital since no single agency will have all the resources needed to save victims, unblock roads and extinguish the fires which might erupt in the disaster space. Given this, coalitions have to be efficiently selected and scheduled to work across the disaster space so as to maximize the number of lives and the portion of the infrastructure saved. In particular, it is important that the selection of such coalitions should be performed in a decentralized fashion in order to avoid a single point of failure in the system. Moreover, it is critical that responders communicate only locally given they are likely to have limited battery power or minimal access to long-range communication devices. Against this background, we provide a novel decentralized solution to the coalition formation process that pervades disaster management. More specifically, we model the emergency management scenario defined in the RoboCup Rescue disaster simulation platform as a coalition formation with spatial and temporal constraints (CFST) problem where agents form coalitions to complete tasks, each with different demands. To design a decentralized algorithm for CFST, we formulate it as a distributed constraint optimization problem and show how to solve it using the state-of-the-art Max-Sum algorithm that provides a completely decentralized message-passing solution. We then provide a novel algorithm (F-Max-Sum) that avoids sending redundant messages and efficiently adapts to changes in the environment. In empirical evaluations, our algorithm is shown to generate better solutions than other decentralized algorithms used for this problem.},

	volume = {33},
	abstract = {Visual coverage of large-scale environments is a key issue for several, important application scenarios, such as large-scale three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, search and rescue, and active video surveillance. In this paper, we consider a setting where a group of robots, equipped with standard cameras, must fully cover a surrounding area while minimizing associated movement costs. To address this problem, we use a descriptor for visual coverage that encodes a measure of the visual information contained in an area, based on a regular discretization of the environment in voxels. In particular, our measure of coverage is related to how much of each voxel volume is "penetrated" by the bundle of rays projected from the camera center. Crucially, our descriptor explicitly encodes the viewing direction from which the voxel is observed, which is a key element to measure coverage of visual sensors. Next, we propose an autonomous cooperative exploration approach to control robot movements. Specifically, based on our visual coverage descriptor, we define a utility function to encode the value of future moves for the robots, and we select the next move for a robot by performing a greedy maximization of such utility function. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach in a simulation scenario based on real visual data and on widely used robotic tools (such as ROS and Stage). Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline random approaches (i.e., random, semirandom, and uncoordinated) and thus is a valid solution for visual coverage in large-scale outdoor scenarios.},

	abstract = {The problem of assigning tasks to a group of robots acting in a dynamic environment is a fundamental issue for a MRS and is relevant to several real world applications. Several techniques have been studied to address this problem, however when the system needs to scale up with size, communication quickly becomes an important issue to address; moreover, tasks to be executed can be tied by constraints that have to be considered in the task assignment process. In this paper we present a distributed task assignment approach that ensures very low communication overhead and can manage constraints among roles. The basic idea of our approach is to use tokens to represent tasks to be executed, each team member creates, executes and propagates tokens based on a broad knowledge of their team mates. We test and evaluate our approach by means of experiments both on a simulates and on a real robot scenario},

	abstract = {The coordination of cooperative agents involved in rescue missions is an important open research problem. We consider the RoboCup Rescue Simulation (RCS) challenge, where teams of agents perform urban rescue operations. Previous approaches typically cast such problem as separate single-team allocation problems. However, different teams have complementary capabilities, and therefore some kind of inter-team coordination is desirable for high-quality solutions. Our contribution considers inter-team coordination using Max-Sum. We present a methodology that allows teams in RCS to efficiently assess joint allocations. Furthermore, we show how to reduce the algorithm's computational complexity from exponential to polynomial time by using Tractable High Order Potentials. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time where it has been shown that MS can be run in polynomial time in the RCS challenge without relaxing the problem. Experiments with fire brigades and police agents show that teams employing inter-team coordination are significantly more effective than uncoordinated teams. Moreover, the evaluation shows that our BMS and THOPs method achieves up to $2.5$ times better results than other state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Decentralised optimisation is a key issue for multi-agent systems, and while many solution techniques have been developed, few provide support for dynamic environments, which change over time, such as disaster management. Given this, in this paper, we present Bounded Fast Max Sum (BFMS): a novel, dynamic, superstabilizing algorithm which provides a bounded approximate solution to certain classes of distributed constraint optimisation problems. We achieve this by eliminating dependencies in the constraint functions, according to how much impact they have on the overall solution value. In more detail, we propose iGHS, which computes a maximum spanning tree on subsections of the constraint graph, in order to reduce communication and computation overheads. Given this, we empirically evaluate BFMS, which shows that BFMS reduces communication and computation done by Bounded Max Sum by up to 99%, while obtaining 60-88% of the optimal utility.},

Due to the #P-hardness of the problem, we propose an efficient approximation method called ε-ProVe. Our approach exploits a controllable underestimation of the output reachable sets obtained via statistical prediction of tolerance limits, and can provide a tight —with provable probabilistic guarantees— lower estimate of the safe areas. Our empirical evaluation on different standard benchmarks shows the scalability and effectiveness of our method, offering valuable insights for this new type of verification of DNNs.},

	abstract = {Multi-agent applications that include teams of mobile sensing agents are challenging since they are inherently dynamic and a single movement of a mobile sensor can change the problem that the whole team is facing. While agents select their positions with respect to the information available to them in their local environment, by moving to a different location they can reveal new information, e.g., targets, which they were not aware of before. Thus, exploration is required for such information to be revealed. A variation of the DCOP model (DCOP_MST) was previously adjusted to represent such problems along with local search algorithms that were enhanced with exploration methods.

In this paper we design an explorative version of Max-sum for solving DCOP_MST, which is based on an iterative process where, at each iteration, agents generate and solve a specific problem instance. We demonstrate that this basic algorithm (Max-sum_MST) converges faster than other standard local search algorithms thatwere adjusted to solve DCOP_MSTs, however, its exploitive naturemakes it inferior to explorative local search algorithms.

Thus, we designed exploration methods that when combined with basic Max-sum_MST, significantly outperform the existing explorative local search algorithms. Moreover, the best performing method we propose also eliminates the exponential time complexity of Max-sum by bounding the number of agents involved in each constraint.},

	abstract = {In the last years, neural networks achieved groundbreaking successes in a wide variety of applications. However, for safety critical tasks, such as robotics and healthcare, it is necessary to provide some specific guarantees before the deployment in a real world context. Even in these scenarios, where high cost equipment and human safety are involved, the evaluation of the models is usually performed with the standard metrics (i.e., cumulative reward or success rate). In this paper, we introduce a novel metric for the evaluation of models in safety critical tasks, the violation rate. We build our work upon the concept of formal verification for neural networks, providing a new formulation for the safety properties that aims to ensure that the agent always makes rational decisions. To perform this evaluation, we present ProVe (Property Verifier), a novel approach based on the interval algebra, designed for the analysis of our novel behavioral properties. We apply our method to different domains (i.e., mapless navigation for mobile robots, trajectory generation for manipulators, and the standard ACAS benchmark). Results show that the violation rate computed by ProVe provides a good evaluation for the safety of trained models. © 2021 37th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, UAI 2021.

	abstract = {Detection of anomalies and faults is a key element for long-term robot autonomy, because, together with subsequent diagnosis and recovery, allows to reach the required levels of robustness and persistency. In this paper, we propose an approach for detecting anomalous behaviors in autonomous robots starting from data collected during their routine operations. The main idea is to model the nominal (expected) behavior of a robot system using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and to evaluate how far the observed behavior is from the nominal one using variants of the Hellinger distance adopted for our purposes. We present a method for online anomaly detection that computes the Hellinger distance between the probability distribution of observations made in a sliding window and the corresponding nominal emission probability distri- bution. We also present a method for onine anomaly detection that computes a variant of the Hellinger distance between two HMMs representing nominal and observed behaviors. The use of the Hellinger distance positively impacts on both detection performance and interpretability of detected anomalies, as shown by results of experiments performed in two real-world application domains, namely, water monitoring with aquatic drones and socially assistive robots for elders living at home. In particular, our approach improves by 6% the area under the ROC curve of standard online anomaly detection methods. The capabilities of our online method to discriminate anomalous behaviors in real-world applications are statistically proved.},

	abstract = {In the Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) task, the human user guides an autonomous agent to reach a target goal via a series of low-level actions following a textual instruction in natural language. However, most existing methods do not address the likely case where users may make mistakes when providing such instruction (e.g., "turn left" instead of "turn right"). In this work, we address a novel task of Interactive VLN in Continuous Environments (IVLN-CE), which allows the agent to interact with the user during the VLN-CE navigation to verify any doubts regarding the instruction errors. We propose an Interactive Instruction Error Detector and Localizer (I2EDL) that triggers the user-agent interaction upon the detection of instruction errors during the navigation. We leverage a pre-trained module to detect instruction errors and pinpoint them in the instruction by cross-referencing the textual input and past observations. In such way, the agent is able to query the user for a timely correction, without demanding the user's cognitive load, as we locate the probable errors to a precise part of the instruction. We evaluate the proposed I2EDL on a dataset of instructions containing errors, and further devise a novel metric, the Success weighted by Interaction Number (SIN), to reflect both the navigation performance and the interaction effectiveness. We show how the proposed method can ask focused requests for corrections to the user, which in turn increases the navigation success, while minimizing the interactions.},

	abstract = {Online planning methods for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have re- cently gained much interest. In this paper, we pro- pose the introduction of prior knowledge in the form of (probabilistic) relationships among dis- crete state-variables, for online planning based on the well-known POMCP algorithm. In particu- lar, we propose the use of hard constraint net- works and probabilistic Markov random fields to formalize state-variable constraints and we extend the POMCP algorithm to take advantage of these constraints. Results on a case study based on Rock- sample show that the usage of this knowledge pro- vides significant improvements to the performance of the algorithm. The extent of this improvement depends on the amount of knowledge encoded in the constraints and reaches the 50% of the average discounted return in the most favorable cases that we analyzed.},

	abstract = {Autonomous drones typically have limited battery capacity, which presents a major challenge for persistent, long-term deployments. In the con- text of water quality monitoring, aquatic drones must navigate rivers and lakes to collect real-time data, where the battery consumption is heavily influenced by dynamic environmental factors such as flowing current and wind. Intelligent bat- tery management is a requirement for the success of these missions. We propose a formalization of the battery management problem in terms of Partially Observ- able Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We model the problem as a POMDP where the agent modulates the energy provided to its propellers. The drone can estimate the “difficulty” to traverse an interval by observing the environment. An important aspect of this formalization is the prediction of future intervals’ difficulty values based on current observations by exploiting a priori geometric information, which we call Task Difficulty Propagation (TDP). We investigate variations of this approach and analyze related performance.},

	volume = {79},
	abstract = {Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a powerful framework for planning under uncertainty. They allow to model state uncertainty as a belief probability distribution. Approximate solvers based on Monte Carlo sampling show great success to relax the computational demand and perform online planning. However, scaling to complex realistic domains with many actions and long planning horizons is still a major challenge, and a key point to achieve good performance is guiding the action-selection process with domain-dependent policy heuristics which are tailored for the specific application domain.  We propose to learn high-quality heuristics from POMDP traces of executions generated by any solver.  We convert the belief-action pairs to a logical semantics, and exploit data- and time-efficient Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to generate interpretable belief-based policy specifications, which are then used as online heuristics. We evaluate thoroughly our methodology on two notoriously challenging POMDP problems, involving large action spaces and long planning horizons, namely, rocksample and pocman. Considering different state-of-the-art online POMDP solvers, including POMCP, DESPOT and AdaOPS, we show that learned heuristics expressed in Answer Set Programming (ASP) yield performance superior to neural networks and similar to optimal handcrafted task-specific heuristics within lower computational time. Moreover, they well generalize to more challenging scenarios not experienced in the training phase (e.g., increasing rocks and grid size in rocksample, incrementing the size of the map and the aggressivity of ghosts in pocman).},

	booktitle = {Proceedings of AAMAS '23: International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems},
	abstract = {Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) is an effi- cient solver for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). It allows scaling to large state spaces by computing an approximation of the optimal policy locally and online, using a Monte Carlo Tree Search based strategy. However, POMCP suffers from sparse reward function, namely, rewards achieved only when the final goal is reached, particularly in environments with large state spaces and long horizons. Recently, logic specifications have been integrated into POMCP to guide exploration and to satisfy safety requirements. However, such policy-related rules require manual definition by domain experts, especially in real-world sce- narios. In this paper, we use inductive logic programming to learn logic specifications from traces of POMCP executions, i.e., sets of belief-action pairs generated by the planner. Specifically, we learn rules expressed in the paradigm of answer set programming. We then integrate them inside POMCP to provide soft policy bias toward promising actions. In the context of two benchmark sce- narios, rocksample and battery, we show that the integration of learned rules from small task instances can improve performance with fewer Monte Carlo simulations and in larger task instances. We make our modified version of POMCP publicly available at https://github.com/GiuMaz/pomcp_clingo.git.},

	abstract = {District Heating (DH) networks are promising technologies for heat distribution in residential and commercial buildings since they enable high efficiency and low emissions. Within the recently proposed paradigm of smart grids, DH networks have acquired intelligent tools able to enhance their efficiency. Among these tools, there are demand fore- casting technologies that enable improved planning of heat production and power station maintenance. In this work we propose a compara- tive study for heat load forecasting methods on a real case study based on a dataset provided by an Italian utility company. We trained and tested three kinds of models, namely non-autoregressive, autoregressive and hybrid models, on the available dataset of heat load and meteoro- logical variables. The best model, in terms of root mean squared error of prediction, was selected. It considers the day of the week, the hour of the day, some meteorological variables, past heat loads and social components, such as holidays. Results show that the selected model is able to achieve accurate 48-hours predictions of the heat load in sev- eral conditions (e.g., different days of the week, different times, holidays and workdays). Moreover, an analysis of the parameters of the selected models enabled to identify a few informative variables.},

State-of-the-art online methods as Velocity Obstacles (VO) guarantee safe local planning, while global planning methods based on reinforcement learning or graph discretization are either computationally inefficient or not provably collision-safe. In this paper, we combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with VO to prune unsafe actions (i.e., colliding velocities). In this way, we can plan with very few MCTS simulations even in very large action spaces (60 actions), achieving higher cumulative reward and lower computational time per step than pure MCTS with many simulations. Moreover, our methodology guarantees collision avoidance thanks to action pruning with VO, while pure MCTS does not. Results in this paper pave the way towards deployment of MCTS planning on real robots and multi-agent decentralized motion planning.},

	year = {2020},
	journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
	volume = {30},
	abstract = {Sensor data generated by intelligent systems, such as autonomous robots, smart buildings and other systems based on artificial intelligence, represent valuable sources of knowledge in today’s data-driven society, since they contain information about the situations these systems face during their operation. These data are usually multivariate time series since modern technologies enable the simultaneous acquisition of multiple signals during long periods of time. In this paper we present a dataset containing sensor traces of six data acquisition campaigns performed by autonomous aquatic drones involved in water monitoring. A total of 5.6 hours of navigation are available, with data coming from both lakes and rivers, and from different locations in Italy and Spain. The monitored variables concern both the internal state of the drone (e.g., battery voltage, GPS position and signals to propellers) and the state of the water (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity). Data were collected in the context of the EU-funded Horizon 2020 project INTCATCH (http://www.intcatch.eu) which aims to develop a new paradigm for monitoring water quality of catchments. The aquatic drones used for data acquisition are Platypus Lutra boats. Both autonomous and manual drive is used in different parts of the navigation. The dataset is analyzed in the paper “Time series segmentation for state-model generation of autonomous aquatic drones: A systematic framework” [1] by means of recent time series clustering/segmentation techniques to extract data-driven models of the situations faced by the drones in the data acquisition campaigns. These data have strong potential for reuse in other kinds of data analysis and evaluation of machine learning methods on real-world datasets [2]. Moreover, we consider this dataset valuable also for the variety of situations faced by the drone, from which machine learning techniques can learn behavioural patterns or detect anomalous activities. We also provide manual labeling for some known states of the drones, such as, drone inside/outside the water, upstream/downstream navigation, manual/autonomous drive, and  drone turning, that represent a ground truth for validation purposes. Finally, the real-world nature of the dataset makes it more challenging for machine learning methods because it contains noisy samples collected while the drone was exposed to atmospheric agents and uncertain water flow conditions.},

We exploit inductive learning of answer set programs from noisy examples to learn a set of logical rules representing an explainable approximation of the agent’s policy at each batch of experience. We then perform answer set reasoning on the learned rules to guide the exploration of the learning agent at the next batch, without requiring inefficient reward shaping and preserving optimality with soft bias. The entire procedure is conducted during the online execution of the reinforcement learning algorithm. We preliminarily validate the efficacy of our approach by integrating it into the Q-learning algorithm for the Pac-Man scenario in two maps of increasing complexity. Our methodology produces a significant boost in the discounted return achieved by the agent, even in the first batches of training. Moreover, inductive learning does not compromise the computational time required by Q-learning and learned rules quickly converge to an explanation of the agent’s policy.},

To this end, the energy grid is evolving towards a distributed architecture called Smart Grid (SG). Moreover, new communication paradigms, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), are being applied to the SG providing advanced communication capabilities for management and control. In this context, a microgrid is a self-sustained network that can operate connected to the SG (or in isolation). In such networks, the long-term scheduling of on/off cycles of devices is a problem that has been commonly addressed by centralized approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel IoT-microgrid architecture to model the long-term optimization scheduling problem as a distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP). We compare different multi-agent DCOP algorithms using different window sizes showing that the proposed architecture can find optimal and near-optimal solutions for a specific case study.},

Our empirical comparison with the state of the art approach on standard datasets confirms significant improvements in speedups (up to +594%), and scalability (as our method can operate on networks whose potential tables exceed the global memory of the GPGPU).},

	abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots employed in industrial applications often operate in complex and uncertain environments. In this paper we propose an approach based on an extension of Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) for robot velocity regulation in industrial-like environments characterized by uncertain motion difficulties. The velocity selected by POMCP is used by a standard engine controller which deals with path planning. This two-layer approach allows POMCP to exploit prior knowledge on the relationships between task similarities to improve performance in terms of time spent to traverse a path with obstacles. We also propose three measures to support human-understanding of the strategy used by POMCP to improve the performance. The overall architecture is tested on a Turtlebot3 in two environments, a rectangular path and a realistic production line in a research lab. Tests performed on a C++ simulator confirm the capability of the proposed approach to profitably use prior knowledge, achieving a performance improvement from 0.7% to 3.1% depending on the complexity of the path. Experiments on a Unity simulator show that the proposed two-layer approach outperforms also single-layer approaches based only on the engine controller (i.e., without the POMCP layer). In this case the performance improvement is up to 37% comparing to a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning engine controller, and up to 51% comparing to the standard ROS engine controller. Finally, experiments in a real-world testing arena confirm the possibility to run the approach on real robots.},

	abstract = {In this paper we focus on the problem of learning an optimal policy for Active Visual Search (AVS) of objects in known indoor environments with an online setup. Our POMP method uses as input the current pose of an agent (e.g. a robot) and a RGB-D frame. The task is to plan the next move that brings the agent closer to the target object. We model this problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process solved by a Monte-Carlo planning approach. This allows us to make decisions on the next moves by iterating over the known scenario at hand, exploring the environment and searching for the object at the same time. Differently from the current state of the art in Reinforcement Learning, POMP does not require extensive and expensive (in time and computation) labelled data so being very agile in solving AVS in small and medium real scenarios. We only require the information of the floormap of the environment, an information usually available or that can be easily extracted from an a priori single exploration run. We validate our method on the publicly available AVD benchmark, achieving an average success rate of 0.76 with an average path length of 17.1, performing close to the state of the art but without any training needed. Additionally, we show experimentally the robustness of our method when the quality of the object detection goes from ideal to faulty.},

Our tests, based on real datasets for both spatial (GeoLife) and social data (Twitter), show that our approach is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art (up to 84 times), allowing us to compute stable payments for 2000 agents in 50 minutes. We also develop a parallel version of our approach, which achieves a near-optimal speed-up in the number of processors used. Finally, our empirical analysis reveals new insights into the relationship between payments incurred by a user by virtue of its position in its social network and its role (rider or driver).},

Reinforcement learning, initially employed in gaming contexts, has been recently applied to real-world domains, including the environmental sustainability realm, where uncertainty challenges strategy learning and adaptation. In this work, we survey the literature to identify the main applications of reinforcement learning in environmental sustainability and the predominant methods employed to address these challenges. We analyzed 181 papers and answered seven research questions, e.g., “How many academic studies have been published from 2003 to 2023 about RL for environmental sustainability?” and “What were the application domains and the methodologies used?”. Our analysis reveals an exponential growth in this field over the past two decades, with a rate of 0.42 in the number of publications (from 2 papers in 2007 to 53 in 2022), a strong interest in sustainability issues related to energy fields, and a preference for single-agent RL approaches to deal with sustainability. Finally, this work provides practitioners with a clear overview of the main challenges and open problems that should be tackled in future research.},

Specifically, we focus on techniques that exploit structural independence among agents' actions to provide optimal solutions to the coordination problem, and, in particular, we use the Generalized Distributive Law (GDL) algorithm. In this settings, we propose a novel resource aware heuristic to build junction trees and to schedule GDL computations across the agents. Our goal is to minimise the total running time of the coordination process, rather than the theoretical complexity of the computation, by explicitly considering the computation and communication capabilities of agents. We evaluate our proposed approach against DPOP, RDPI and a centralized solver on a number of benchmark coordination problems, and show that our approach is able to provide optimal solutions for DCOPs faster than previous approaches. Specifically, in the settings considered, when resources are scarce our approach is up to three times faster than DPOP (which proved to be the best among the competitors in our settings).},

	abstract = {Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) is a powerful online algorithm that can generate approximate policies for large Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes. The online nature of this method supports scalability by avoiding complete policy representation. However, the lack of an explicit policy representation hinders interpretability and a proper evaluation of the risks an agent may incur. In this work, we propose a methodology based on Maximum Satisﬁability Modulo Theory (MAX-SMT) for analyzing POMCP policies by inspecting their traces, namely, sequences of belief- action pairs generated by the algorithm. The proposed method explores local properties of the policy to build a compact and informative summary of the policy behaviour. Moreover, we introduce a rich and formal language that a domain expert can use to describe the expected behaviour of a policy. In more detail, we present a formulation that directly computes the risk involved in taking actions by considering the high- level elements speciﬁed by the expert. The ﬁnal formula can identify risky decisions taken by POMCP that violate the expert indications. We show that this identiﬁcation process can be used oﬄine (to improve the policy’s explainability and identify anomalous behaviours) or online (to shield the risky decisions of the POMCP algorithm). We present an extended evaluation of our approach on four domains: the well-known tiger and rocksample benchmarks, a problem of velocity regulation in mobile robots, and a problem of battery management in mobile robots. We test the methodology against a state-of- the-art anomaly detection algorithm to show that our approach can be used to identify anomalous behaviours in faulty POMCP. We also show, comparing the performance of shielded and unshielded POMCP, that the shielding mechanism can improve the system’s performance. We provide an open-source implementation of the proposed methodologies at https://github.com/GiuMaz/XPOMCP.},

The online nature of this method supports scalability by avoiding complete policy representation. The lack of an explicit representation however hinders policy interpretability and makes policy verification very complex. In this work, we propose two contributions. The first is a method for identifying unexpected actions selected by POMCP with respect to expert prior knowledge of the task. The second is a shielding approach that prevents POMCP from selecting unexpected actions. The first method is based on Maximum Satisfiability Modulo Theory (MAX-SMT). It inspects traces (i.e., sequences of belief-action-observation triplets) generated by POMCP to compute the parameters of logical formulas about policy properties defined by the expert. The second contribution is a module that uses online the logical formulas to identify anomalous actions selected by POMCP and substitutes those actions with actions that satisfy the logical formulas fulfilling expert knowledge. We evaluate our approach in two domains. Results show that the shielded POMCP outperforms the standard POMCP in a case study in which a wrong parameter of POMCP makes it select wrong actions from time to time. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

In particular, we focus on safety, a fundamental problem in RL that arises when it is applied to domains involving humans or hazardous uncertain situations. We propose to use deep neural networks, formal verification, and online refinement of domain knowledge to improve the transparency and efficiency of the learning process, as well as the quality of the final policies. We present two case studies, specifically (i) autonomous water monitoring and (ii) smart control of air quality indoors. In particular, we discuss the challenges and solutions to these problems, addressing crucial issues such as anomaly detection and prevention, real-time control, and online learning. We believe that the proposed techniques can be used to overcome some limitations of RL, providing safe and efficient solutions to complex and urgent problems.},

	abstract = {We consider the Social Ridesharing (SR) problem, where a set of commuters, connected through a social network, arrange one-time rides at short notice. In particular, we focus on the associated optimisation problem of forming cars to minimise the travel cost of the overall system modelling such problem as a graph constrained coalition formation (GCCF) problem, where the set of feasible coalitions is restricted by a graph (i.e., the social network). Moreover, we significantly extend the state of the art algorithm for GCCF, i.e., the CFSS algorithm, to solve our GCCF model of the SR problem. Our empirical evaluation uses a real dataset for both spatial (GeoLife) and social data (Twitter), to validate the applicability of our approach in a realistic application scenario. Empirical results show that our approach computes optimal solutions for systems of medium scale (up to 100 agents) providing significant cost reductions (up to -36.22%). Moreover, we can provide approximate solutions for very large systems (i.e., up to 2000 agents) and good quality guarantees (i.e., with an approximation ratio of 1.41 in the worst case) within minutes (i.e., 100 seconds).},

	title = {Skeleton-Based Orienteering for Level Set Estimation},
	year = {2016},
	publisher = {IOS Press},
	booktitle = {EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
	abstract = {In recent years, the use of unmanned vehicles for monitoring spatial environmental phenomena has gained increasing attention. Within this context, an interesting problem is level set estimation, where the goal is to identify regions of space where the analyzed phenomena (for example the PH value in a body of water) is above or below a given threshold level. Typically, in the literature this problem is approached with techniques which search for the most interesting sampling locations to collect the desired information (i.e., locations where we can gain the most information by sampling). However, the common assumption underlying this class of approaches is that acquiring a sample is expensive (e.g., in terms of consumed energy and time). In this paper, we take a different perspective on the same problem by considering the case where a mobile vehicle can continuously acquire measurements with a negligible cost, through high rate sampling sensors. In this scenario, it is crucial to reduce the path length that the mobile platform executes to collect the data. To address this issue, we propose a novel algorithm, called Skeleton-Based Orienteering for Level Set Estimation (SBOLSE). Our approach starts from the LSE formulation introduced in [10] and formulates the level set estimation problem as an orienteering problem. This allows one to determine informative locations while considering the length of the path. To combat the complexity associated with the orienteering approach, we propose a heuristic approach based on the concept of topological skeletonization. We evaluate our algorithm by comparing it with the state of the art approaches (i.e., LSE and LSE-batch) both on a real world dataset extracted from mobile platforms and on a synthetic dataset extracted from CO2 maps. Results show that our approach achieves a near optimal classification accuracy while significantly reducing the travel distance (up to 70% w.r.t LSE and 30% w.r.t. LSE-batch).},

Tasks to be allocated are dynamically perceived from the environment and can be tied by execution constraints. Conflicts among team mates arise when an uncontrolled number of robots execute the same task, resulting in waste of effort and spatial conflicts. The critical aspect of task allocation in Multi Robot Systems is related to conflicts generated by limited and noisy perception capabilities of real robots. This requires significant extensions to the task allocation techniques developed for software agents. The proposed approach is able to successfully allocate roles to robots avoiding conflicts among team mates and maintaining low communication overhead. We implemented our method on AIBO robots and performed quantitative analysis in a simulated environment.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 had substantial effects on the IoT community which designs systems for safety: the urge to face masks worn by everyone, the analysis of crowds to avoid the spread of the disease, and the sanitization of public environments has led to exceptional research acceleration and fast engineering of the related solutions. Now that the pandemic is losing power, some applications are becoming less important, while others are proving to be useful regardless of the criticality of COVID-19. The Safe Place project is a prime example of this situation (DATE23 MPP category: final stage). Safe Place is an Italian 3M euro regional industrial/academic project, financed by European funds, created to ensure a multidisciplinary choral reaction to COVID-19 in critical environments such as rest homes and public places. Safe Place consortium was able to understand what is no longer useful in this post-pandemic period, and what instead is potentially attractive for the market. For example, the detection of face masks has little importance, while sanitization does have much. This paper shares such analysis, which emerged through a co-design process of three public Safe Place project demonstrators, involving heterogeneous figures spanning from scientists to lawyers.},

Specifically, we consider a setting where a group of robots equipped with camera only must fully cover a surrounding area while minimizing associated movement costs. To address this problem we propose a novel descriptor for visual coverage that aims at measuring visual information of an area based on a regular discretization of the environment in voxels.Moreover, we propose an autonomous cooperative exploration approach which controls the robot movements so to maximize information accuracy (defined based on our visual coverage descriptor) and minimizing movement costs. Finally, we define a simulation scenario based on real visual data and on widely used robotic tools (such as ROS and Stage) to empirically evaluate our approach. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms a baseline random approach and an uncoordinated one, thus being a valid solution for visual coverage in large scale outdoor scenarios.},

The tool provides an integrated architecture for i) generating and updating in real-time predictive models of heating load, ii) supporting the analysis of prediction performance and errors, iii) inspecting model parameters and analyzing the historical dataset from which models are trained. A case study is presented in which the software is used on a synthetic dataset of heat loads and weather forecast from which a regression model is generated and updated every 24 h, while predictions of load in the next 48 h are performed every hour.

	abstract = {I sistemi biologici sono gruppi di entità biologiche (es. molecole ed organismi), che interagiscono producendo specifiche dinamiche. Questi sistemi sono solitamente caratterizzati da una elevata complessità perchè coinvolgono un elevato numero di componenti con molte interconnessioni. La comprensione dei meccanismi che governano i sistemi biologici e la previsione dei loro comportamenti in condizioni normali e patologiche è una sfida cruciale della biologia dei sistemi (in inglese detta systems biology), un'area di ricerca al confine tra biologia, medicina, matematica ed informatica.

In questa tesi i P sistemi metabolici, detti brevemente sistemi MP, sono stati utilizzati come modello discreto per l'analisi di dinamiche biologiche. Essi sono una classe deterministica dei P sistemi classici, che utilizzano regole di riscrittura per rappresentare le reazioni chimiche e "funzioni di regolazioni di flusso" per regolare la reattività di ciascuna reazione rispetto alla quantita' di sostanze presenti istantaneamente nel sistema.

Dopo un excursus sulla letteratura relativa ad alcuni modelli convenzionali (come le equazioni differenziali ed i modelli stocastici proposti da Gillespie) e non-convenzionali (come i P sistemi ed i P sistemi metabolici), saranno presentati i risultati della mia ricerca. Essi riguardano tre argomenti principali: i) l'equivalenza tra sistemi MP e reti di Petri ibride funzionali,  ii) le prospettive statistiche e di ottimizzazione nella generazione di sistemi MP a partire da dati sperimentali, iii) lo sviluppo di un laboratorio virtuale chiamato MetaPlab, un software Java basato sui sistemi MP.

L'equivalenza tra i sistemi MP e le reti di Petri ibride funzionali è stata dimostrata per mezzo di due teoremi ed alcuni esperimenti al computer per il caso di studio del meccanismo regolativo del gene operone lac nella pathway glicolitica. Il secondo argomento di ricerca concerne nuovi approcci per la sintesi delle funzioni di regolazione di flusso. La regressione stepwise e le reti neurali sono state impiegate come approssimatori di funzioni, mentre algoritmi di ottimizzazione classici ed evolutivi (es. backpropagation, algoritmi genetici, particle swarm optimization ed algoritmi memetici) sono stati impiegati per l'addestramento dei modelli. Una completo workflow per l'analisi dei dati sperimentali è stato presentato. Esso gestisce ed indirizza l'intero processo di sintesi delle funzioni di regolazione, dalla preparazione dei dati alla selezione delle variabili, fino alla generazione dei modelli ed alla loro validazione. Le metodologie proposte sono state testate con successo tramite esperimenti al computer sui casi di studio dell'oscillatore mitotico negli embrioni anfibi e del non photochemical quenching (NPQ). L'ultimo tema di ricerca è infine piu' applicativo e riguarda la progettazione e lo sviluppo di una architettura Java basata su plugin e di una serie di plugin che consentono di automatizzare varie fasi del processo di modellazione con sistemi MP, come la simulazione di dinamiche, la determinazione dei flussi e la generazione delle funzioni di regolazione.},

In this paper, we propose an approach for detecting anomalous behaviors in autonomous robots starting from data collected during their routine operations. The main idea is to model the nominal (expected) behavior of a robot system using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and to evaluate how far the observed behavior is from the nominal one using variants of the Hellinger distance adopted for our purposes. We present a method for online anomaly detection that computes the Hellinger distance between the probability distribution of observations made in a sliding window and the corresponding nominal emission probability distri- bution. We also present a method for onine anomaly detection that computes a variant of the Hellinger distance between two HMMs representing nominal and observed behaviors. The use of the Hellinger distance positively impacts on both detection performance and interpretability of detected anomalies, as shown by results of experiments performed in two real-world application domains, namely, water monitoring with aquatic drones and socially assistive robots for elders living at home. In particular, our approach improves by 6% the area under the ROC curve of standard online anomaly detection methods. The capabilities of our online method to discriminate anomalous behaviors in real-world applications are statistically proved.},

	abstract = {In the Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) task, the human user guides an autonomous agent to reach a target goal via a series of low-level actions following a textual instruction in natural language. However, most existing methods do not address the likely case where users may make mistakes when providing such instruction (e.g., "turn left" instead of "turn right"). In this work, we address a novel task of Interactive VLN in Continuous Environments (IVLN-CE), which allows the agent to interact with the user during the VLN-CE navigation to verify any doubts regarding the instruction errors. We propose an Interactive Instruction Error Detector and Localizer (I2EDL) that triggers the user-agent interaction upon the detection of instruction errors during the navigation. We leverage a pre-trained module to detect instruction errors and pinpoint them in the instruction by cross-referencing the textual input and past observations. In such way, the agent is able to query the user for a timely correction, without demanding the user's cognitive load, as we locate the probable errors to a precise part of the instruction. We evaluate the proposed I2EDL on a dataset of instructions containing errors, and further devise a novel metric, the Success weighted by Interaction Number (SIN), to reflect both the navigation performance and the interaction effectiveness.

	abstract = {Autonomous drones typically have limited battery capacity, which presents a major challenge for persistent, long-term deployments. In the con- text of water quality monitoring, aquatic drones must navigate rivers and lakes to collect real-time data, where the battery consumption is heavily influenced by dynamic environmental factors such as flowing current and wind. Intelligent bat- tery management is a requirement for the success of these missions. We propose a formalization of the battery management problem in terms of Partially Observ- able Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We model the problem as a POMDP where the agent modulates the energy provided to its propellers. The drone can estimate the “difficulty” to traverse an interval by observing the environment. An important aspect of this formalization is the prediction of future intervals’ difficulty values based on current observations by exploiting a priori geometric information, which we call Task Difficulty Propagation (TDP). We investigate variations of this approach and analyze related performance.},

	volume = {79},
	abstract = {Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a powerful framework for planning under uncertainty. They allow to model state uncertainty as a belief probability distribution. Approximate solvers based on Monte Carlo sampling show great success to relax the computational demand and perform online planning. However, scaling to complex realistic domains with many actions and long planning horizons is still a major challenge, and a key point to achieve good performance is guiding the action-selection process with domain-dependent policy heuristics which are tailored for the specific application domain.  We propose to learn high-quality heuristics from POMDP traces of executions generated by any solver.  We convert the belief-action pairs to a logical semantics, and exploit data- and time-efficient Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to generate interpretable belief-based policy specifications, which are then used as online heuristics. We evaluate thoroughly our methodology on two notoriously challenging POMDP problems, involving large action spaces and long planning horizons, namely, rocksample and pocman. Considering different state-of-the-art online POMDP solvers, including POMCP, DESPOT and AdaOPS, we show that learned heuristics expressed in Answer Set Programming (ASP) yield performance superior to neural networks and similar to optimal handcrafted task-specific heuristics within lower computational time. Moreover, they well generalize to more challenging scenarios not experienced in the training phase (e.g., increasing rocks and grid size in rocksample, incrementing the size of the map and the aggressivity of ghosts in pocman).},

	abstract = {Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) is an effi- cient solver for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). It allows scaling to large state spaces by computing an approximation of the optimal policy locally and online, using a Monte Carlo Tree Search based strategy. However, POMCP suffers from sparse reward function, namely, rewards achieved only when the final goal is reached, particularly in environments with large state spaces and long horizons. Recently, logic specifications have been integrated into POMCP to guide exploration and to satisfy safety requirements. However, such policy-related rules require manual definition by domain experts, especially in real-world sce- narios. In this paper, we use inductive logic programming to learn logic specifications from traces of POMCP executions, i.e., sets of belief-action pairs generated by the planner. Specifically, we learn rules expressed in the paradigm of answer set programming. We then integrate them inside POMCP to provide soft policy bias toward promising actions. In the context of two benchmark sce- narios, rocksample and battery, we show that the integration of learned rules from small task instances can improve performance with fewer Monte Carlo simulations and in larger task instances. We make our modified version of POMCP publicly available at https://github.com/GiuMaz/pomcp_clingo.git.},

	abstract = {District Heating (DH) networks are promising technologies for heat distribution in residential and commercial buildings since they enable high efficiency and low emissions. Within the recently proposed paradigm of smart grids, DH networks have acquired intelligent tools able to enhance their efficiency. Among these tools, there are demand fore- casting technologies that enable improved planning of heat production and power station maintenance. In this work we propose a compara- tive study for heat load forecasting methods on a real case study based on a dataset provided by an Italian utility company. We trained and tested three kinds of models, namely non-autoregressive, autoregressive and hybrid models, on the available dataset of heat load and meteoro- logical variables. The best model, in terms of root mean squared error of prediction, was selected. It considers the day of the week, the hour of the day, some meteorological variables, past heat loads and social components, such as holidays. Results show that the selected model is able to achieve accurate 48-hours predictions of the heat load in sev- eral conditions (e.g., different days of the week, different times, holidays and workdays). Moreover, an analysis of the parameters of the selected models enabled to identify a few informative variables.},

State-of-the-art online methods as Velocity Obstacles (VO) guarantee safe local planning, while global planning methods based on reinforcement learning or graph discretization are either computationally inefficient or not provably collision-safe. In this paper, we combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with VO to prune unsafe actions (i.e., colliding velocities). In this way, we can plan with very few MCTS simulations even in very large action spaces (60 actions), achieving higher cumulative reward and lower computational time per step than pure MCTS with many simulations. Moreover, our methodology guarantees collision avoidance thanks to action pruning with VO, while pure MCTS does not. Results in this paper pave the way towards deployment of MCTS planning on real robots and multi-agent decentralized motion planning.},

	year = {2020},
	journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
	volume = {30},
	abstract = {Sensor data generated by intelligent systems, such as autonomous robots, smart buildings and other systems based on artificial intelligence, represent valuable sources of knowledge in today’s data-driven society, since they contain information about the situations these systems face during their operation. These data are usually multivariate time series since modern technologies enable the simultaneous acquisition of multiple signals during long periods of time. In this paper we present a dataset containing sensor traces of six data acquisition campaigns performed by autonomous aquatic drones involved in water monitoring. A total of 5.6 hours of navigation are available, with data coming from both lakes and rivers, and from different locations in Italy and Spain. The monitored variables concern both the internal state of the drone (e.g., battery voltage, GPS position and signals to propellers) and the state of the water (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity). Data were collected in the context of the EU-funded Horizon 2020 project INTCATCH (http://www.intcatch.eu) which aims to develop a new paradigm for monitoring water quality of catchments. The aquatic drones used for data acquisition are Platypus Lutra boats. Both autonomous and manual drive is used in different parts of the navigation. The dataset is analyzed in the paper “Time series segmentation for state-model generation of autonomous aquatic drones: A systematic framework” [1] by means of recent time series clustering/segmentation techniques to extract data-driven models of the situations faced by the drones in the data acquisition campaigns. These data have strong potential for reuse in other kinds of data analysis and evaluation of machine learning methods on real-world datasets [2]. Moreover, we consider this dataset valuable also for the variety of situations faced by the drone, from which machine learning techniques can learn behavioural patterns or detect anomalous activities. We also provide manual labeling for some known states of the drones, such as, drone inside/outside the water, upstream/downstream navigation, manual/autonomous drive, and  drone turning, that represent a ground truth for validation purposes. Finally, the real-world nature of the dataset makes it more challenging for machine learning methods because it contains noisy samples collected while the drone was exposed to atmospheric agents and uncertain water flow conditions.},

	abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots employed in industrial applications often operate in complex and uncertain environments. In this paper we propose an approach based on an extension of Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) for robot velocity regulation in industrial-like environments characterized by uncertain motion difficulties. The velocity selected by POMCP is used by a standard engine controller which deals with path planning. This two-layer approach allows POMCP to exploit prior knowledge on the relationships between task similarities to improve performance in terms of time spent to traverse a path with obstacles. We also propose three measures to support human-understanding of the strategy used by POMCP to improve the performance. The overall architecture is tested on a Turtlebot3 in two environments, a rectangular path and a realistic production line in a research lab. Tests performed on a C++ simulator confirm the capability of the proposed approach to profitably use prior knowledge, achieving a performance improvement from 0.7% to 3.1% depending on the complexity of the path. Experiments on a Unity simulator show that the proposed two-layer approach outperforms also single-layer approaches based only on the engine controller (i.e., without the POMCP layer). In this case the performance improvement is up to 37% comparing to a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning engine controller, and up to 51% comparing to the standard ROS engine controller. Finally, experiments in a real-world testing arena confirm the possibility to run the approach on real robots.},

	year = {2020},
	booktitle = {British Machine Vision Conference},
	abstract = {In this paper we focus on the problem of learning an optimal policy for Active Visual Search (AVS) of objects in known indoor environments with an online setup. Our POMP method uses as input the current pose of an agent (e.g. a robot) and a RGB-D frame. The task is to plan the next move that brings the agent closer to the target object. We model this problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process solved by a Monte-Carlo planning approach. This allows us to make decisions on the next moves by iterating over the known scenario at hand, exploring the environment and searching for the object at the same time. Differently from the current state of the art in Reinforcement Learning, POMP does not require extensive and expensive (in time and computation) labelled data so being very agile in solving AVS in small and medium real scenarios. We only require the information of the floormap of the environment, an information usually available or that can be easily extracted from an a priori single exploration run. We validate our method on the publicly available AVD benchmark, achieving an average success rate of 0.76 with an average path length of 17.1, performing close to the state of the art but without any training needed. Additionally, we show experimentally the robustness of our method when the quality of the object detection goes from ideal to faulty.},

	volume = {57},
	abstract = {Environmental sustainability is a worldwide key challenge attracting increasing attention due to climate change, pollution, and biodiversity decline. Reinforcement learning, initially employed in gaming contexts, has been recently applied to real-world domains, including the environmental sustainability realm, where uncertainty challenges strategy learning and adaptation. In this work, we survey the literature to identify the main applications of reinforcement learning in environmental sustainability and the predominant methods employed to address these challenges. We analyzed 181 papers and answered seven research questions, e.g., “How many academic studies have been published from 2003 to 2023 about RL for environmental sustainability?” and “What were the application domains and the methodologies used?”. Our analysis reveals an exponential growth in this field over the past two decades, with a rate of 0.42 in the number of publications (from 2 papers in 2007 to 53 in 2022), a strong interest in sustainability issues related to energy fields, and a preference for single-agent RL approaches to deal with sustainability. Finally, this work provides practitioners with a clear overview of the main challenges and open problems that should be tackled in future research.},

	year = {2023},
	journal = {ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
	volume = {324},
	abstract = {Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) is a powerful online algorithm that can generate approximate policies for large Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes. The online nature of this method supports scalability by avoiding complete policy representation. However, the lack of an explicit policy representation hinders interpretability and a proper evaluation of the risks an agent may incur. In this work, we propose a methodology based on Maximum Satisﬁability Modulo Theory (MAX-SMT) for analyzing POMCP policies by inspecting their traces, namely, sequences of belief- action pairs generated by the algorithm. The proposed method explores local properties of the policy to build a compact and informative summary of the policy behaviour. Moreover, we introduce a rich and formal language that a domain expert can use to describe the expected behaviour of a policy. In more detail, we present a formulation that directly computes the risk involved in taking actions by considering the high- level elements speciﬁed by the expert. The ﬁnal formula can identify risky decisions taken by POMCP that violate the expert indications. We show that this identiﬁcation process can be used oﬄine (to improve the policy’s explainability and identify anomalous behaviours) or online (to shield the risky decisions of the POMCP algorithm). We present an extended evaluation of our approach on four domains: the well-known tiger and rocksample benchmarks, a problem of velocity regulation in mobile robots, and a problem of battery management in mobile robots. We test the methodology against a state-of- the-art anomaly detection algorithm to show that our approach can be used to identify anomalous behaviours in faulty POMCP. We also show, comparing the performance of shielded and unshielded POMCP, that the shielding mechanism can improve the system’s performance. We provide an open-source implementation of the proposed methodologies at https://github.com/GiuMaz/XPOMCP.},

	abstract = {Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning (POMCP) is a powerful online algorithm able to generate approximate policies for large Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes. The online nature of this method supports scalability by avoiding complete policy representation. The lack of an explicit representation however hinders policy interpretability and makes policy verification very complex. In this work, we propose two contributions. The first is a method for identifying unexpected actions selected by POMCP with respect to expert prior knowledge of the task. The second is a shielding approach that prevents POMCP from selecting unexpected actions. The first method is based on Maximum Satisfiability Modulo Theory (MAX-SMT). It inspects traces (i.e., sequences of belief-action-observation triplets) generated by POMCP to compute the parameters of logical formulas about policy properties defined by the expert. The second contribution is a module that uses online the logical formulas to identify anomalous actions selected by POMCP and substitutes those actions with actions that satisfy the logical formulas fulfilling expert knowledge. We evaluate our approach in two domains. Results show that the shielded POMCP outperforms the standard POMCP in a case study in which a wrong parameter of POMCP makes it select wrong actions from time to time. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

In particular, we focus on safety, a fundamental problem in RL that arises when it is applied to domains involving humans or hazardous uncertain situations. We propose to use deep neural networks, formal verification, and online refinement of domain knowledge to improve the transparency and efficiency of the learning process, as well as the quality of the final policies. We present two case studies, specifically (i) autonomous water monitoring and (ii) smart control of air quality indoors. In particular, we discuss the challenges and solutions to these problems, addressing crucial issues such as anomaly detection and prevention, real-time control, and online learning. We believe that the proposed techniques can be used to overcome some limitations of RL, providing safe and efficient solutions to complex and urgent problems.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 had substantial effects on the IoT community which designs systems for safety: the urge to face masks worn by everyone, the analysis of crowds to avoid the spread of the disease, and the sanitization of public environments has led to exceptional research acceleration and fast engineering of the related solutions. Now that the pandemic is losing power, some applications are becoming less important, while others are proving to be useful regardless of the criticality of COVID-19. The Safe Place project is a prime example of this situation (DATE23 MPP category: final stage). Safe Place is an Italian 3M euro regional industrial/academic project, financed by European funds, created to ensure a multidisciplinary choral reaction to COVID-19 in critical environments such as rest homes and public places. Safe Place consortium was able to understand what is no longer useful in this post-pandemic period, and what instead is potentially attractive for the market. For example, the detection of face masks has little importance, while sanitization does have much. This paper shares such analysis, which emerged through a co-design process of three public Safe Place project demonstrators, involving heterogeneous figures spanning from scientists to lawyers.},

	abstract = {The increasing level of autonomy of robots poses challenges of trust and social acceptance, especially in human-robot interaction scenarios. This requires an interpretable implementation of robotic cognitive capabilities, possibly based on formal methods as logics for the definition of task specifications. However, prior knowledge is often unavailable in complex realistic scenarios. In this paper, we propose an offline algorithm based on inductive logic programming from noisy examples to extract task specifications (i.e., action preconditions, constraints and effects) directly from raw data of few heterogeneous (i.e., not repetitive) robotic executions. Our algorithm leverages on the output of any unsupervised action identification algorithm from video-kinematic recordings. Combining it with the definition of very basic, almost task-agnostic, commonsense concepts about the environment, which contribute to the interpretability of our methodology, we are able to learn logical axioms encoding preconditions of actions, as well as their effects in the event calculus paradigm. Since the quality of learned specifications depends mainly on the accuracy of the action identification algorithm, we also propose an online framework for incremental refinement of task knowledge from user’s feedback, guaranteeing safe execution. Results in a standard manipulation task and benchmark for user training in the safety-critical surgical robotic scenario, show the robustness, data- and time-efficiency of our methodology, with promising results towards the scalability in more complex domains.},

	volume = {79},
	abstract = {Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a powerful framework for planning under uncertainty. They allow to model state uncertainty as a belief probability distribution. Approximate solvers based on Monte Carlo sampling show great success to relax the computational demand and perform online planning. However, scaling to complex realistic domains with many actions and long planning horizons is still a major challenge, and a key point to achieve good performance is guiding the action-selection process with domain-dependent policy heuristics which are tailored for the specific application domain.  We propose to learn high-quality heuristics from POMDP traces of executions generated by any solver.  We convert the belief-action pairs to a logical semantics, and exploit data- and time-efficient Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to generate interpretable belief-based policy specifications, which are then used as online heuristics. We evaluate thoroughly our methodology on two notoriously challenging POMDP problems, involving large action spaces and long planning horizons, namely, rocksample and pocman. Considering different state-of-the-art online POMDP solvers, including POMCP, DESPOT and AdaOPS, we show that learned heuristics expressed in Answer Set Programming (ASP) yield performance superior to neural networks and similar to optimal handcrafted task-specific heuristics within lower computational time. Moreover, they well generalize to more challenging scenarios not experienced in the training phase (e.g., increasing rocks and grid size in rocksample, incrementing the size of the map and the aggressivity of ghosts in pocman).},

	abstract = {Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) is an effi- cient solver for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). It allows scaling to large state spaces by computing an approximation of the optimal policy locally and online, using a Monte Carlo Tree Search based strategy. However, POMCP suffers from sparse reward function, namely, rewards achieved only when the final goal is reached, particularly in environments with large state spaces and long horizons. Recently, logic specifications have been integrated into POMCP to guide exploration and to satisfy safety requirements. However, such policy-related rules require manual definition by domain experts, especially in real-world sce- narios. In this paper, we use inductive logic programming to learn logic specifications from traces of POMCP executions, i.e., sets of belief-action pairs generated by the planner. Specifically, we learn rules expressed in the paradigm of answer set programming. We then integrate them inside POMCP to provide soft policy bias toward promising actions. In the context of two benchmark sce- narios, rocksample and battery, we show that the integration of learned rules from small task instances can improve performance with fewer Monte Carlo simulations and in larger task instances. We make our modified version of POMCP publicly available at https://github.com/GiuMaz/pomcp_clingo.git.},

	abstract = {Motion planning in dynamic environments is a challenging robotic task, requiring collision avoidance and real-time computation. State-of-the-art online methods as Velocity Obstacles (VO) guarantee safe local planning, while global planning methods based on reinforcement learning or graph discretization are either computationally inefficient or not provably collision-safe. In this paper, we combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with VO to prune unsafe actions (i.e., colliding velocities). In this way, we can plan with very few MCTS simulations even in very large action spaces (60 actions), achieving higher cumulative reward and lower computational time per step than pure MCTS with many simulations. Moreover, our methodology guarantees collision avoidance thanks to action pruning with VO, while pure MCTS does not. Results in this paper pave the way towards deployment of MCTS planning on real robots and multi-agent decentralized motion planning.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach combining inductive logic programming with reinforcement learning to improve training performance and explainability. We exploit inductive learning of answer set programs from noisy examples to learn a set of logical rules representing an explainable approximation of the agent’s policy at each batch of experience. We then perform answer set reasoning on the learned rules to guide the exploration of the learning agent at the next batch, without requiring inefficient reward shaping and preserving optimality with soft bias. The entire procedure is conducted during the online execution of the reinforcement learning algorithm. We preliminarily validate the efficacy of our approach by integrating it into the Q-learning algorithm for the Pac-Man scenario in two maps of increasing complexity. Our methodology produces a significant boost in the discounted return achieved by the agent, even in the first batches of training. Moreover, inductive learning does not compromise the computational time required by Q-learning and learned rules quickly converge to an explanation of the agent’s policy.},
