### [BEHAVE - Learning Safe Behaviours for human-robot cooperation](https://isla-lab.github.io/projects/behave/)

The BEHAVE project develops new AI methodologies to assess and certify the quality of decisions for intelligent robotic systems. In particular, the BEHAVE project addresses issues related to the formal verification of Deep Neural Networks trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches, in order to certify the behaviors of robots interacting with humans.
