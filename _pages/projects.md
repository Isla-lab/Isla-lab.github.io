# Active Projects

### [SYNERGHY (PON FESR)](https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=progetto&id=6183&lang=en)

The SINERGHY project focuses on the development of an integrated and innovative energy system, combining advanced technologies for the production, storage and management of energy from renewable sources. It aims to develop advanced and integrated technological solutions to improve energy efficiency and environmental sustainability.


### [VALORLEGNO (PON FESR)](https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=progetto&id=6207&lang=en)

The general objective of the project is the design and prototyping of an integrated solution to support the traceability of the wood supply chain through the use of blockchain technology, supported by advanced anomaly detection techniques for quality assurance. 

# Past Projects

### [BEHAVE - Learning Safe Behaviours for human-robot cooperation (FAIR - MUR)](https://isla-lab.github.io/projects/behave/)

The BEHAVE project develops new AI methodologies to assess and certify the quality of decisions for intelligent robotic systems. In particular, the BEHAVE project addresses issues related to the formal verification of Deep Neural Networks trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches, in order to certify the behaviors of robots interacting with humans.

### [INTCATCH - Development and application of Novel, Integrated Tools for monitoring and managing Catchments (EU Horizon)](https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=progetto&id=4833)

INTCATCH will instigate a paradigm shift in the monitoring and management of surface water quality that is fit
for global waters in the period 2020-2050. INTCATCH will do this by developing efficient, user-friendly water
monitoring strategies and systems based on innovative technologies that will provide real time data for important
parameters, moving towards SMART Rivers. The business model will transform water governance by facilitating
sustainable water quality management by community groups and NGOs using a clouds data linked to a decision
support system and eco-innovative technologies.
