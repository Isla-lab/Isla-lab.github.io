# Research

Our research group aims at developing methodological and applied research in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and data analysis for intelligent systems.

#### Artificial Intelligence algorithms (Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning) for Autonomous Surface Vehicles
In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful technique to solve complex problems in a variety of applications, reaching and often outperforming classical algorithms and humans. Our research focuses mainly in novel RL methodologies that address the problem of safety, i.e., the application of RL solutions to problems and domains involving interaction with humans, hazardous situations and expensive hardware.

In particular, we propose to exploit DRL to generate a DNN-based real-time controller for the water monitoring drone and mobile robotics.

#### Non-Volatile Memory
Non-Volatile Memory technologies (such as [3D XPoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_XPoint)) are gaining traction in the world of computer architecture today. It has the advantage of lower power consumption, and greater capacity than traditional DRAM based memory technologies.

In this field we explore the management of such devices, and optimizations that can be made to filesystems and operating systems for performance gains.

#### Internet of Things

Every day the world is getting more connected, with a plethora of devices being connected to networks. These can improve life, but how can we make sure these devices are safe from malicious actors, without hurting performance?
