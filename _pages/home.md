The research group of the Intelligent Systems Lab (ISLa) aims at developing methodological and applied research in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and data analysis for intelligent systems. The methodologies investigated range from reinforcement learning and planning under uncertainty to multi-agent coordination, probabilistic modeling and statistical data analysis. The application domains range from robotics and industry 4.0 to cybersecurity and cyber physical systems, to provide a few examples. The group participates in national and international projects, and has collaborations with Italian and foreign research centers.
